# SUSTech-CS217-ReviewSheet
This is the simplified version of course slides of CS217 - DSAA(H) (16 A4 pages), including fundamental concepts, the contents of algorithms and data structures, which may be more convenient to review for the final exam. 

Instructor: Pietro Simone Oliveto

Semester: 2025 Fall

- Lecture $1 \sim 7$: Sorting algorithms
- Lecture $8 \sim 10$: Stack, Queue, Linked-list, Binary Search Tree(BST) and AVL Tree
- Lecture $11,12$: Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithm
- Lecture $13 \sim 15$: Graph (BFS, DFS, Spanning Trees, Shortest paths)

Note: Because the contents in this sheet have been shortened, it may be lack of sufficient diagrams for procedures, and examples for understanding.
